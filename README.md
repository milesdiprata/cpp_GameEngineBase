# cpp_GameEngineBase
A reusable base game engine class for C++ using SDL2. Handles graphics/drawing, user input and game loop logic!

Implement this base class in your own game and override the drawing methods (as needed), OnUserCreate and OnUserUpdate methods.

OnUserCreate: Your static variables and data goes here... Run once at the start of the game.

OnUserUpdate: This method gets called in every iteration of the main game loop. Put your game and rendering logic in here!
